Welcome to the `DataScience@OregonState` platform. The folder where this file resides is your 'home directory' - its contents
are readable and writable only by you and instructors of this 'Hub' (`@@JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL@@`).

Your instructor may ask you to find other files outside of your home directory; you can browse to other folders by clicking
the folder icon in the upper left of the file browser ( 📁`/@@NB_USER@@/` ).

If you double-clicked this file, you likely don't see this text nicely formatted. Try right-clicking on it and choose `Open With -> Markdown Preview`.
