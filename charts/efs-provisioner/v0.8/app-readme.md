# EFS Provisioner

NOTE - THIS APP IS NOT YET TESTED OR DEBUGGED. 

This is basically a rancher/helm chart wrapper around https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/aws/efs, 
currently forked from v0.1.2.

Note that an EFS volume must be setup and prerequisites met per the instructions linked above.
